The [Faktory Pro](https://contribsys.com/faktory) macOS package is a bare binary which can replace the `faktory` binary installed by Homebrew. You are welcome to use it to trial the Faktory Pro functionality before purchase but it may not be used in a "production" environment. Linux DEB packages are only available after [purchase](https://contribsys.com/faktory).
